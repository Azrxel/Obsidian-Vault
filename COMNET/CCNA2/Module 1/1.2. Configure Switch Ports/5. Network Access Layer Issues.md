- The output from the `show interfaces` command is useful for detecting common media issues.
  One of the most important parts of this output is the display of the line and Data Link Protocol Status, as shown in the Example.
  
- The First Parameter (FastEthernet0/18 is up) refers to the Hardware Layer and Indicates whether the Interface is receiving a carrier detect signal.
- The Second Parameter (line protocol is up) refers to the Data Link Layer and Indicates whether the Data Link Layer Protocol keepalive are being received.
- Based on the output of the `show interfaces` command, possible problems can be fixed as follows:
	- If the interface is up and the line protocol is down, a problem exists.
	  There could be an encapsulation type mismatch, the interface on the other end could be error-disabled, or there could be a hardware problem.
	- If the line protocol and the interface are both down, a cable is not attached, or some other interface problem exists.
	  For example, in a back-to-back connection, the other end of the connection, the other end of the connection may be administratively down.
	- If the interface is administratively down, it has been manually disabled (the `shutdown` command has been issued) in the active configuration.

	- The `show interfaces` command output displays counters and statistics for the FastEthernet 0/18 interface, as shown here:

- Some Media Errors are not severe enough to cause the circuit to fail but do cause network performance issues.
  The Table explains some of these common error which can be detected using the `show interfaces` command:
