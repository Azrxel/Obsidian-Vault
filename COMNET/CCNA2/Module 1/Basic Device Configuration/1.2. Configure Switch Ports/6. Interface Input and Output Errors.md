"Input Errors" is the sum of all errors in datagrams that were received on the interface being examined.

This includes Runts, Giants, CRC, No Buffer, Frame, Overrun, and Ignored Counts.

The reported input errors from the `show interfaces` command include the following:
- Runt Frames:
  Ethernet Frames that are shorter than the 64-Byte minimum allowed length are called Runts.
  Malfunctioning NICs are the usual cause of excessive Run
