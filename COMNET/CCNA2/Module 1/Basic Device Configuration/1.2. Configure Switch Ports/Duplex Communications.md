- Full-Duplex communications increase bandwidth efficiency by allowing both ends of a connection to transmit and receive data simultaneously. 
  This is also know as bidirectional communication and it requires microsegmentation.
- A microsegmented LAN is created when a Switch Port has only one Device connected and is operating in Full-Duplex Mode.
  There is no collision domain associated with a Switch Port Operating in Full-Duplex Mode.
- Unlike Full-Duplex Communication, Half-Duplex Communication is unidirectional.
  Half-Duplex Communication creates Performance issues because Data flows only in one Direction at a time, resulting in collisions.
- Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gb NICs require Dull-Duplex connection to Operate.
  In Full-Duplex Mode, the Collision Detection Circuit on the NIC is Disabled.
  Full-Duplex offers 100 efficiency in both Directions (transmitting and receiving). This results in a doubling of potential use of the stated Bandwidth.
