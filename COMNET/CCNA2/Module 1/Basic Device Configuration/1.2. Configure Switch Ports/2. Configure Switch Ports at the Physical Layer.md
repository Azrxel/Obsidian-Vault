- Switch Ports can be manually configured with specific Duplex and Speed settings.
  The respective interface configuration commands `duplex` and `speed`. 
- The Default settings for both Duplex and Speed for Switch Ports on <mark class="hltr-yellow">Cisco Catalyst 2960 & 3560</mark> Switches is Auto.
  The 10/100/1000 Ports operate in either half-  or Full-Duplex Mode when they are set to 10 or 100 Mbps and operate only in Full-Duplex Mode when set to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps).
- Autonegotiation is useful when the Speed and Duplex settings of the Device connecting to the port are unknown or may change.
  When connecting to known Devices such as Servers, Dedicated Workstations, or Network Devices, a best practice is to manually set the Speed and Duplex settings.
- When troubleshooting Switch Port Issues, it is important that the Duplex and Speed settings are checked.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark>
Mismatched settings for the Duplex Mode and Speed of Switch Ports can cause connectivity issues.
Autonegotiation failure creates mismatched settings.

All Fiber-Optic Ports, such 1000BASE-SX Ports, operate only at one Preset Speed and are always Full-Duplex.
