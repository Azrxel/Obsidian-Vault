By Default, The Switch is configured to have its management controlled through VLAN 1.

### Step 1
Configure the Management Interface: 
- From VLAN Interface Configuration Mode, an IPv4 Address and Subnet Mask is applied to the Management SVI of the Switch.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark> The SVI for VLAN 99 will not appear as "up/up" until VLAN 99  is created and there is a Device connected to a Switch Port associated with VLAN 99.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark> The Switch may need to be Configured for IPv6.
For Example: Before you can configure IPv6 Addressing on a Cisco Catalyst 2960 running IOS version 15.0, you will need to enter the Global Configuration Command <mark class="hltr-red">`sdm prefer dual-ipv4-andipv6 default`</mark> and <mark class="hltr-red">`reload`</mark> the Switch
