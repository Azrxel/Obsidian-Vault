By Default, The Switch is configured to have its management controlled through VLAN 1.

### Step 1
<mark class="hltr-orange">Configure the Management Interface:</mark> 
- From VLAN Interface Configuration Mode, an IPv4 Address and Subnet Mask is applied to the Management SVI of the Switch.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark>
The SVI for VLAN 99 will not appear as "up/up" until VLAN 99  is created and there is a Device connected to a Switch Port associated with VLAN 99.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark>
The Switch may need to be Configured for IPv6.
For Example: Before you can configure IPv6 Addressing on a Cisco Catalyst 2960 running IOS version 15.0, you will need to enter the Global Configuration Command <mark class="hltr-red">`sdm prefer dual-ipv4-and-ipv6 default`</mark> and <mark class="hltr-red">`reload`</mark> the Switch.

### Step 2
<mark class="hltr-orange">Configure the Default Gateway</mark>
- The Switch should be configured with a Default Gateway if it will be managed remotely from Networks that are not Directly Connected.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark>
Because, it will receive its Default Gateway info from the Router Advertisement (RA) message, the Switch does not Require an IPv6

### Step 3:
<mark class="hltr-orange">Verify Configuration</mark>
- The `show ip interface brief` and `show ipv6 interface brief` commands are useful for determining the status of both Physical and Virtual Interfaces.
  The output shown confirms that interface VLAN 99 has been configured with an IPv4 and IPv6 Address.
