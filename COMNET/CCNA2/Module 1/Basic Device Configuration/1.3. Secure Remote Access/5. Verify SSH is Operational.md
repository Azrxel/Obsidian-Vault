On a PC, an SSH Client such as PuTTY, is used to connect to an SSH Server.

For example, assume the following is Configured:
- SSH is Enabled on Switch S1
- Interface VLAN 99 (SVI) with IPv4 Address 172.17.99.11 on Switch S1
- PC1 with IPv4 Address 172.17.99.21
	Using a terminal, initiate an SSH connection to the SVI VLAN IPv4 Address of S1 from PC1.
	
	When connected, the user is prompted for a username and password as shown in the example.
	
	Using the configuration from the previos example, the username `admin` and the password `ccna` are entered.
	
	After entering the correct combination, the user is connected via SSH to the Command Line Interface (CLI) on the Catalyst 2960 Switch.
	
```
	Login as: admin
	Using keyboard-intercative
	Authentication.
	Password:
	S1> enable
	Password:
	S1#
```

To Display the session and configuration data for SSH on the Device that you configured as an SSH Server, use the `show ip ssh` command.

In the example, SSH Version 2 is Enabled.
