Another common configuration of Cisco IOS Routers is enabling a Loopback Interface.
- The Loopback Interface is a Logical Interface that is internal to the Router.
  It is not assigned to a Physical Port and can never be connected to any other Device.
  It is considered a Software Interface that is automatically placed in "up" state, as long as the Router is functioning.
- The Loopback Interface is useful in testing and managing a Cisco IOS Device because it ensures that at least one Interface will always be available.
  For Example, it can be used for Testing purposes, such as testing Internal Routing Processes, by emulating Networks behind the Router.
- Loopback Interfaces are also commonly used in Lab Environments to create additional interfaces.
  For Example, you can create multiple loopback interfaces on a router to simulate more Networks for configuration practice and testing purposes.
  The IPv4 Address for each loopback interface must be unique and unused by any other interface.
  
- Enabling and assigning a loopback address:
```
   Router (config) # interface loop number
   Router (config-if) # ip address ip-address subnet-mask
```
