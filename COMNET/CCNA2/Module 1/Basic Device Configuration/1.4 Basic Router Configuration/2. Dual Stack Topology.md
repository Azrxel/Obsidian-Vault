- One distinguishing feature between Switches and Routers is the type of interfaces supported by each.
- For Example, Layer 2 Switches support LANs; therefore, they have multiple Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet Ports.
  
- The Dual Stack Topology in the figure is used to Demonstrate the Configuration of Router IPv4 and IPv6 Interfaces.
