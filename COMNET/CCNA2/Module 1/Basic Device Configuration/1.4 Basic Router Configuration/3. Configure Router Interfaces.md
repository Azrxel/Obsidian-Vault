- Routers support LANs and WANs and can interconnect different types of Networks; therefore, they support many types of interfaces.
- For example, G2 ISRs have one or two Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Interfaces and High-Speed WAN Interface Card (HWIC) slots to accommodate other types of Network Interfaces, including Serial, DSL, and Cable Interfaces.

- To be available, an interface must be:
  1. **Configured with at least one IP Address** - Use the `ip address ip-address subnet-mask` and the `ipv6 address ipv6-address/prefix` interface configuration commands.
  2. **Activated** - By Default, LAN and WAN interfaces are not activated (**shutdown**).
     To Enable an Interface, it must be activated using the `no shutdown` command (This is similar to powering on the interface).
     The Interface must also be connected to another Device
