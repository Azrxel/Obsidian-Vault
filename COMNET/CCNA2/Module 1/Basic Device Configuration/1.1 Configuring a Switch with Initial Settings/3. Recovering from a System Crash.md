The Bootloader provides access into the Switch if the Operating System cannot be used because of missing or damaged System files. The Bootloader has a command line that provides access to the files stored in flash memory. The Bootloader can be accessed through a console connection following these steps:

### Step 1:
Connect a PC by console cable to the Switch console port.
Configure terminal emulation software to connect to the Switch

### Step 2:
Unplug The Switch Power Cord

### Step 3:
Reconnect the power cord to the Switch and, within 15 seconds, press and hold down the **MODE** button while the System LED is still flashing <mark class="hltr-green">Green</mark>.

### Step 4:
Continue holding down the **MODE** button until the System LED turns briefly <mark class="hltr-orange">Amber</mark> and the solid <mark class="hltr-green">Green</mark>; then release the **MODE** button.

### Step 5:
The Bootloader Switch: prompt appears in the terminal emulation software on the PC.
The Bootloader command line supports commands to format the flash file system, reinstall the Operating System Software, and recover a lost or Forgotten password.

For Example: The `dir` command can be used to view a list of files within a specific directory.
