- The output of the `show ip route` and `show ipv6 route` commands reveal the Three **directly connected network** entries and the Three **local host route interface** entries, as shown in the example.

![[1.5.5 show ip-ipv6 command.png|show ip/ipv6 command]]

- The **local host** route has an administrative distance of 0. 
- It also has a <mark class="hltr-green">/32</mark> Mask (<mark class="hltr-blue">IPv4</mark>),
  and a <mark class="hltr-green">/128</mark> Mask (<mark class="hltr-blue">IPv6</mark>).
-  The local host route is for routes on the Router that owns the IP Address.
- It is used to allow the Router to process packets destined to that IP.

- A "<mark class="hltr-pink">C</mark>" next to a Route within the Routing Table indicates that this is a **Directly Connected Network**.
- When the Router interface is configured with a **Global Unicast Address** and is in the "<mark class="hltr-green">up/up</mark>" state, the IPv6 Prefix and Prefix Length are added to the IPv6 <mark class="hltr-yellow">Routing Table</mark> as a **connected route**.

- The <mark class="hltr-blue">IPv6</mark> **Global Unicast Address** applied to the interface is also installed in the Routing Table as a **Local Route**.
- The **Local Route** has a <mark class="hltr-green">/128</mark> Prefix.
- **Local Routs** are used by the Routing Table to efficiently process packets with the Interface Address of the Router as the Destination.
