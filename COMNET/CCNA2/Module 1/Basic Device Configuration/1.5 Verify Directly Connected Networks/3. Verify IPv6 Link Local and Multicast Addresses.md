- The output of the `show ipv6 interface breif` command displays two configured IPv6 Addresses per interface.
- One Address is the IPv6 Global Unicast Address that was manually entered.
- The Other Address, which begins with FE80, is the Link-Local Unicast Address for the Interface.
- A Link-Local Address is automatically added to an Interface whenever a Global Unicast Address is assigned.
- An IPv6 Network Interface is required to have a Link-Local Address, but not necessarily a Global Unicast Address.

- The `show ipv6 interface gigabitethernet 0/0/0` command displays the interface status and all of the IPv6 Address belonging to the interface.
- Along with the Link-Local Address and Global Unicast Address, the output includes the Multicast Addresses assigned to the interface, beginning with Prefix FF02
