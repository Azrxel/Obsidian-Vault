- Commands that generate multiple screens of Output are, by Default, paused after 24 Lines.
- At the End of the paused Output, the --More-- text displays.
  Pressing **Enter** displays the next line and pressing **spacebar** displays the next set of lines.
- Use the `terminal length` command to specify the number of lines to be displayed. A value of 0 (zero) prevents the Router from pausing between screens of Output.

- Another very useful feature that improves the user experience in the CLI is the **filtering** of the `show` Output.
- **Filtering** commands can be used to Display specific sections of Output.
- To  enable **filtering** command, enter a pipe (`|`) character after the `show` command and ether a filtering parameter and a filtering expression.

- There are **Four** Filtering Parameters that can be configured after the Pipe:
	1. `section` - Shows the entire section that starts with the filtering expression.
	2. `include` - Includes all Output lines that match the filtering expression.
	3. `exclude` - Excludes all Output lines that match the filtering expression.
	4. `begin` - Shows all the output lines from a certain point, starting with the line matches the filtering expression.
