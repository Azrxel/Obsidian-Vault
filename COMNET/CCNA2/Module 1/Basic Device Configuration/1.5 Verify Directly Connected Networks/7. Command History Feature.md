The Command History Feature is useful because it temporarily stores the list of executed commands to be recalled.
- To recall commands in the **history buffer**, press <mark class="hltr-yellow">Ctrl+P</mark> or <mark class="hltr-yellow">Up Arrow</mark> Key.
  The command output begins with the most recent command.
  Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands.
  
  To return to more recent commands in  the **History Buffer**, press <mark class="hltr-yellow">Ctrl+N</mark> or the <mark class="hltr-yellow">Down Arrow</mark> Key.
  Repeat the key sequence to recall successively more recent commands

- By **Default**, command history is **enabled** and the system captures the last 10 command lines in its history buffer.
  Use the `show history` privileged EXEC command to display the contents of the buffer.
- It is also practical to increase the number of command lines that the history buffer records during the current terminal session only.
- Use the `terminal histroy size` user EXEC command to increase or decrease the size of the buffer.
