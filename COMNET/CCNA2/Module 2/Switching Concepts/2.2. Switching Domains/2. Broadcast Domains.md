A Broadcast Domain extends across all Layer 1 or Layer 2 Devices on a LAN.

- Only a Layer 3 Device (Router) will break the Broadcast Domain, also called a MAC Address Domain.
- The Broadcast Domain consists of all Devices on the LAN that receive the Broadcast Traffic.

When the Layer 2 Switch receives the broadcast it will flood it out all interfaces except for the Ingress Interface.

- Too many broadcasts may cause congestions and poor network performance.
- Increasing Devices at Layer 1 or Layer 2 will cause the Broadcast Domain to expand.
