Switches eliminate collision domains and reduce congestion.

- When there is **Full-Duplex** on the Link, the **Collision Domains** are **Eliminated**.

- When there is one or more devices in Half-Duplex, there will now be a **Collision Domain**.
  - There will now be contention for the Bandwidth.
  - Collisions are now possible.

- Most Devices, including Cisco and Microsoft use Auto-Negotiation as the Default setting for Duplex & Speed.
