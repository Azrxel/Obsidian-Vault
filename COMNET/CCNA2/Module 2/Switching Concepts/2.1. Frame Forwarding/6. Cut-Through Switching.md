Cut-Through forwards the frame **immediately** after determining the destination MAC.

Fragment (Frag) Free Method will check the destination and ensure that the Frame is at least 64 bytes.
This will eliminate runts.

**Concepts of Cut-Through Switching:**

- Is appropriate for Switches needing latency to under 10 Microseconds
- Does not check the FCS, so it can propagate errors.
- May lead to Bandwidth issues if the switch propagates too many errors.
- Cannot support ports with differing speeds going from **Ingress** to **Egress**.
