The Switch uses a 2 Step Process:

**Step 1:**
**Learn** - Examines Source Address
- Adds the Source MAC if not in Table
- Resets the timeout setting back to 5 minutes if the source is in the table
  
**Step 2:**
**Forward** - Examines Destination Address
- If the destination MAC is in the MAC Address Table it is Forwarded out the specified Port
- If the destination is not in the Table, it is flooded out all the interfaces except the one it was received on.
