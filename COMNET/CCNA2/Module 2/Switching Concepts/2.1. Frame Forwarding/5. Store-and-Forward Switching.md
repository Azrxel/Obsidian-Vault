Store-and-Forward Switching has 2 Primary Characteristics:

- **Error Checking** - The Switch will check the **Frame Check Sequence** (FCS) for **CRC Errors**.
  Bad Frames will be Discarded.
  
- **Buffering** - The **Ingress** Interface will buffer the frame while it checks the FCS.
  This also allows the Switch to adjust to a potential difference in Speeds between the **Ingress** and **Egress** Ports.
