Switches use Software on **Application-Specific-Integrated Circuits** (ASICS) to make very quick decisions.

A Switch will use one of two Methods to make Forwarding decisions after it receives a frame:

- **Store-and-Forward Switching** - Receives the entire frame and ensures the Frame is Valid.
  **Store-and-Forward Switching** is Cisco's preferred Switching Method.
  
- **Cut-Through Switching** - Forwards the Frame immediately after determining the destination MAC Address of an incoming frame and the **Egress Port**.
