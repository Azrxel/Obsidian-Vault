The first Inter-VLAN Routing solution relied on using a Router with multiple Ethernet Interfaces.
  Each Router Interface was connected to a Switch Port in different VLANs.
  The Router Interfaces served as the Default Gateways to the Local Hosts on the VLAN Subnet.

Legacy Inter-VLAN Routing using physical Interfaces works, but it has a significant limitation.
  It is not reasonably scalable because Router have a limited number of Physical Interfaces.
  Requiring one Physical Router Interface per VLAN quickly exhausts the Physical Interface capacity of a Router.

This method of Inter-VLAN Routing is no longer implemented in Switched Networks and is included for explanation purposes only.
