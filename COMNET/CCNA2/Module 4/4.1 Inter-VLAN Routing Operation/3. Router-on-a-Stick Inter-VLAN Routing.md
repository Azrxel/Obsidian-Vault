The **'Router-on-a-Stick'** Inter-VLAN Routing method overcomes the limitation of the Legacy Inter-VLAN Routing Method.

It only requires one physical Ethernet Interface to Route Traffic between multiple VLANs on a Network.

- A Cisco IOS Router Ethernet Interface is configured as an 802.1Q Trunk and connected to a Trunk Port on a Layer 2 Switch.
  Specifically, the Router Interface is configured using sub-interfaces to identify Routable VLANs.
  
- The configured sub-interfaces are **Software-Based Virtual Interfaces**.
  Each associated with a single Ethernet Interface.
  Sub-interfaces are configured in Software on a Router.
  Each Sub-Interface is independently configured with an IP Address and VLAN assignment.
  Sub-Interfaces are configured for different Subnets that correspond to their VLAN assignment.
  This Facilitates Logical Routing.
  
- When VLAN-Tagged Traffic enters the Router Interface, it is forwarded to the VLAN Interface.
  After a Routing decision is made based on the destination IP Network Address, the Router determines the exit Interface for the Traffic.
  If the exit Interface is configured as an 802.1Q Sub-interface, the Data Frames are VLAN-Tagged with the new VLAN and sent back out the Physical Interface.
