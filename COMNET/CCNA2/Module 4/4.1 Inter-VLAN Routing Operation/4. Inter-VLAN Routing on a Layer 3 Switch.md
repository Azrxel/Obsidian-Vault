The Modern Method of performing Inter-VLAN Routing is to use Layer 3 Switches and Switched Virtual Interfaces (<mark class="hltr-pink">SVI</mark>).

An <mark class="hltr-pink">SVI</mark> is a Virtual Interface that is configured on a Layer 3 Switch, as shown in the Figure:

#### <mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark>
A Layer 3 Switch is also called a <mark class="hltr-green">Multilayer Switch</mark>, as it operates at Layer 2 and Layer 3.
However, in this course we use the term Layer 3 Switch.
