The Modern Method of performing Inter-VLAN Routing is to use Layer 3 Switches and Switched Virtual Interfaces (<mark class="hltr-pink">SVI</mark>).

An <mark class="hltr-pink">SVI</mark> is a Virtual Interface that is configured on a Layer 3 Switch, as shown in the Figure:

#### <mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark>
A Layer 3 Switch is also called a <mark class="hltr-green">Multilayer Switch</mark>, as it operates at Layer 2 and Layer 3.
However, in this course we use the term Layer 3 Switch.

Inter-VLAN SVIs are created the same way that the management VLAN Interface is configured.
The SVI is created for a VLAN that exists on the Switch.
Although Virtual, the SVI performs the same functions for the VLAN as a Router Interface would.
Specifically, it provides Layer 3 processing for packets that are sent to or from all Switch Ports associated with that VLAN.

The following are **advantages** of using **Layer 3 Switches** for **Inter-VLAN Routing**:
- They are much faster that Router-on-a-Stick because everything is Hardware Switched and Routed.
- There is no need for External Links from the Switch to the Router for Routing.
- They are not limited to one link because Layer 2 EtherChannels can be used as Trunk Links between the Switches to increase Bandwidth.
- Latency is much lower because data does not need to leave the Switch in order to be routed to a different Network.
- They more commonly deployed in Campus LAN than Routers.
- The only disadvantage is that Layer 3 Switches are more expensive.
