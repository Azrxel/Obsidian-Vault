The router-on-a-stick method requires you to create a sub-interface for each VLAN to be routed.

A sub-interface is created using the `interface <interface_id>.<subinterface_id>` global configuration mode command.

The sub-interface syntax is the <mark class="hltr-cyan">physical interface</mark> followed by a <mark class="hltr-green">period</mark> and a <mark class="hltr-yellow">sub-interface number</mark>.

Although not required, it is <mark class="hltr-cyan">customary</mark> to <u>match</u> the <mark class="hltr-green">sub-interface number</mark> with the <mark class="hltr-pink">VLAN Number</mark>

Each sub-interface is then configured with the following two commands:

- `encapsulation dot1q <vlan_id>`
