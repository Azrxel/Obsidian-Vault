### Default VLAN
VLAN 1 is the following:
- The Default VLAN
- The Default Native VLAN
- The Default Management VLAN
- Cannot be deleted or renamed

#### <mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark> 
While we cannot delete 'VLAN 1' Cisco will recommend that we assign these Default Features to these VLANs

### Data VLAN
- Dedicated to **user-generated traffic** (email and web traffic)
- VLAN 1 is the Default data VLAN because all interfaces are assigned to this VLAN

### Native VLAN
- This is used for **Trunk Links** only
- All frames are tagged on an **802.1Q trunk Link** except for those on the **Native VLAN**

### Management VLAN
- This is used for **SSH/Telnet** VTY Traffic and should not be carried with End User Traffic
- Typically, The VLAN that is the SVI for the Layer 2 Switch

### Voice VLAN
- A separate VLAN is required because Voice Traffic requires:
	- Assured Bandwidth
	- High QoS Priority
	- Ability to Avoid Congestion
	- A Delay less than <mark class="hltr-cyan">150ms</mark> from Source to Destination
	- The entire Network must be designed to support voice
