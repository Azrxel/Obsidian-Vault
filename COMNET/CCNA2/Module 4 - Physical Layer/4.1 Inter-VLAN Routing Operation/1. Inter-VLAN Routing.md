VLANs are used to **segment** switched Layer 2 Networks for a variety of reasons.

Regardless of the reason, hosts in one VLAN cannot communicate with hosts in another VLAN unless there is a Router or a Layer 3 Switch to provide routing services.

Inter-VLAN Routing is the process of forwarding Networking Traffic from one VLAN to another VLAN.

There are three Inter-VLAN Routing options:
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Legacy Inter-VLAN Routing</mark> - This is a Legacy Solution. It does not scale well.
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Router-on-a-Stick</mark> - This is an acceptable solution for a small to medium-sized Network.
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Layer 3 Switch using Switched Virtual Interfaces (SVIs</mark>) - This is the most scalable solution for medium to large Organizations.
