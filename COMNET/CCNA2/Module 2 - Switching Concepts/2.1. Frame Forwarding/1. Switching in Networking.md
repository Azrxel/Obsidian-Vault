Two terms are associated with frames entering or leaving an Interface:

- **Ingress** - <mark class="hltr-cyan">entering</mark> the Interface
- **Egress** - <mark class="hltr-cyan">exiting</mark> the Interface

A Switch forwards based on the ingress Interface and the destination MAC Address.

A Switch uses its MAC Address table to make forwarding decisions.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note:</mark> A Switch will never allow traffic to be forwarded out the interface it received the traffic.
