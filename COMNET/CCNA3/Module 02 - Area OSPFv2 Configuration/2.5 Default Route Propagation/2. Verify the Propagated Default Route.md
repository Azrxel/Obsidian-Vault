- You can verify the Default Route settings on R2 using the `show ip route` command.
  You can also verify that R1 and R3 received a Default Route.
- Notice that the Route Source on R1 is $O^*E2$, signifying that it was learned using OSPFv2.
  The asterisk identifies this as a good candidate for the Default Route.
  The E2 designation identifies that it is an External Route.
  The meaning of E1 and E2 is beyond the scope of this Module.
