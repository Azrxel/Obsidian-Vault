After configuring Single-Area OSPFv2, you will need to verify your configurations.
The following two commands are particularly useful for verifying Routing:
- `show ip interface brief`
  This verifies that the desired Interfaces are active with correct IP Addressing.
- `show ip route`
  This verifies that the routing table contains all the expected routes.

Additional commands for determining that OSPF is operating as expected include the following:
- `show ip ospf neigbor`
- `show ip protocols`
- `show ip ospf`
- `show ip ospf interface`

- Use the `show ip ospf neighbor` command to verify that the Router has formed an adjacency with its neighboring Routers. If the Router ID of the Neighboring Router is not displayed, or if it does not show as being in a state of FULL, the two Routers have not formed an OSPFv2 Adjacency.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>: A non-DR or BDR Router that has a Neighbor Relationship with another non-DR or BDR Router will display a Two-Way Adjacency instead of Full.

- The following command output displays the Neighbor Table of R1.

Two Routers may not form an OSPFv2 Adjacency if the following occurs:
- The Subnet Masks do not match, causing the Routers to be on separate Networks.
- The OSPFv2 Hello or Dead Timers do not match.
- The OSPFv2 Network Types do not match.
- There is a missing or incorrect OSPFv2 Network command.
