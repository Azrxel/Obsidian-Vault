- If the Interface Priorities are equal on all Routers, the Router with the Highest Router ID is elected as the DR.
- Instead of relying on the Router ID, it is better to control the election by setting Interface Priorities.
  this also allows a Router to be the DR in one Network and a DROTHER in another.
- To set the Priority of an Interface, use the command `ip ospf priority value` where value is 0 - 255.
  - A value of 0 does not become a DR or a BDR.
  - A value of 1 to 255 on the Interface makes it more likely that the Router becomes the DR or the BDR
