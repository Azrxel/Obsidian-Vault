After configuring Single-Area OSPFv2, you will need to verify your configurations.
The following two commands are particularly useful for verifying Routing:
- `show ip interface brief`
  This verifies that the desired Interfaces are active with correct IP Addressing.
- `show ip route`
  This verifies that the routing table contains all the expected routes.

Additional commands for determining that OSPF is operating as expected include the following:
- `show ip ospf neigbor`
- `show ip protocols`
- `show ip ospf`
- `show ip ospf interface`
