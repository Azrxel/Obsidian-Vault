Reasons to manually set the Cost Value include:
- The Admin may want to influence path selection within OSPF, causing different paths to be selected than what normally would, given default costs and cost accumulation.
- Connections to equipment from other Vendors who use a different formula to calculate OSPF cost.

To change the cost value reported by the Local OSPF Router to other OSPF Routers, use the Interface configuration command `ip ospf cost value`
