- Routing Protocols use a metric to determine the best path of a packet across a Network.
  OSPF uses cost as a metric.
  A lower cost indicates a better path.
- The Cisco cost of an Interface is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the interface.
  Therefore, a Higher Bandwidth  indicates a lower cost.
  
  The formula used to calculate the OSPF cost is:
	  Cost = reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth
