- Routing Protocols use a metric to determine the best path of a packet across a Network.
  OSPF uses cost as a metric.
  A lower cost indicates a better path.
- The Cisco cost of an Interface is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the interface.
  Therefore, a Higher Bandwidth  indicates a lower cost.
  
  The formula used to calculate the OSPF cost is:
	  **Cost = reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth** 

- The default reference bandwidth is 10$^8$ (100,000,000); therefore, the formula is:
	  **Cost = 100,000,000 bps / interface bandwidth in bps**

- Because the OSPF cost value must be an integer, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 GigE Interfaces share the same cost.
  To correct this situation, you can:
  - Adjust the reference bandwidth with the `auto-cost reference-bandwidth` command on each OSPF Router.
  - Manually set the OSPF cost value with the `ip ospf cost` command on necessary Interfaces.
