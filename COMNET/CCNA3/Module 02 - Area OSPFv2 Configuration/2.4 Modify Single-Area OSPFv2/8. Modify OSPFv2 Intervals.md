- It may be desirable to change the OSPF Timers so that Routers detect network failures in less time.
  Doing this increases traffic, but sometimes the need for quick convergence is more important than the extra traffic it creates.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>: The default Hello and Dead Intervals are based on best practices and should be altered in rare situations.

- OSPFv2 Hello and Dead Intervals can be modified manually using the following Interface configuration mode commands:
  ![[2.4.8 Modifying OSPFv2 Intervals.png|Modifying OSPFv2 Intervals]]
- Use the `no ip ospf hello-interval` and `no ip ospf dead-interval` commands to reset the intervals to their default.
- In the example, the Hello Interval for the link between R1 and R2 is changed to 5 seconds.
  The Cisco IOS automatically modifies the Dead <mark class="hltr-yellow">Interval to Four Times</mark> the Hello Interval.
  However, you can document the new Dead Interval in the configuration by manually setting it to 20 seconds, as shown.
- When the Dead Timer on R1 expires, R1 and R2 lose adjacency.
  R1 and R2 must be configured with the same Hello Interval.
  Use the `show ip ospf neighbor` command on R1 to verify the Neighbor Adjacencies.
