- OSPFv2 Hello Packets are transmitted to Multicast Address 224.0.0.5 (all OSPF Routers) every 10 seconds.
  This is the Default Timer Value on Multiaccess and Point-to-Point Networks.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>: Hello Packets are not sent on Interfaces set to passive by the `passive interfae` command.

- The Dead Interval is the period that the Router waits to receive a Hello Packet before declaring the Neighbor down.
  If the Dead Interval expires before the Routers receive a Hello Packet, OSPF removes that Neighbor from its Link-State Database (LSDB).
  The Router floods the LSDB with Information about the down Neighbor out all OSPF-Enabled Interfaces.
  Cisco uses a default of 4 times the Hello Interval
  This is 40 seconds
