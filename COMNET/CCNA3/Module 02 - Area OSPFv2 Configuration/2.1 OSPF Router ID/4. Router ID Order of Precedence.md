Cisco Routers derive the Router ID based on one of Three criteria, in the following preferential order:
1. The Router ID is explicitly configured using the OSPF `router-id rid` router configuration mode command.
   This is the recommended method to assign a Router ID.
2. The Router chooses the highest IPv4 Address of any of the configured Loopback Interfaces.
3. the Router chooses the highest Active IPv4 Address of any of its Physical Interfaces.
