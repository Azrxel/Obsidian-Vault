OSPFv2 is enabled using `router ospf process-id` global configuration mode command.
The *process-id* value represents a number  between 1 and 65,535 and is selected by the Network Administrator.
The *process-id* value is locally significant.
It is considered best practice to use the same *process-id* on all OSPF Routers.
