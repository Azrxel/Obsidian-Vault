Instead of relying on physical Interface, the Router ID can be assigned to a Loopback Interface.

Typically, the IPv4 Address for this Type of Loopback Interface should be configured using a 32-Subnet Mask (255.255.255.255).
This effectively creates a host route would not get advertised as a Route to other OSPF Routers.

OSPF does not need to be enabled on an Interface for that Interface to be chosen as the Router ID.
