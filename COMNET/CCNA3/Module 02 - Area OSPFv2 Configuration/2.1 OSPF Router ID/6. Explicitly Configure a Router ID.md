In our reference Topology the Router ID for each Router is assigned as follows:

- R1 uses Router ID 1.1.1.1
- R2 uses Router ID 2.2.2.2
- R3 uses Router ID 3.3.3.3

Use the `router-id rid` router configuration mode command to manually assign a Router ID.

In the example, the Router ID 1.1.1.1 is assigned to R1.
Use the `show ip protocols` command to verify the Router ID.
