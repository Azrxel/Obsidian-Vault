- An OSPF Router ID is a 32-Bit Value, represented as an IPv4 Address.
  It is used to uniquely identify an OSPF Router, and all OSPF Packets include the Router ID of the Originating Router.
- Every Router requires a Router ID to participate in an OSPF Domain.
  It can be defined by an Administrator or Automatically assigned by the Router.
  The Router ID is used by an OSPF-Enabled Router to do the following:
  - **Participate in the Synchronization of OSPF Databases** 
    During the Exchange State, the Router with the Highest Router ID will send their Database Descriptor (DBD) Packets first.
  - **Participate in the Election of the Designated Router (DR)**
    In a Multiaccess LAN Environment, the Router with the Highest Router ID is elected the DR.
    The Routing Device with the second Highest Router ID is elected the Backup Designated Router (BDR)
