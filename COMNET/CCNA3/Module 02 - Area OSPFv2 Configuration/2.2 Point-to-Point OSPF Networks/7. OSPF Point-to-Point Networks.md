By default, Cisco Routers elect a DR and BDR on the Ethernet Interfaces, even if there is only one other device on the link.
You can verify this with the `show ip ospf interface` command.
The DR/BDR election process is unnecessary as there can only be two Routers on the Point-to-Point Network between R1 and R2.

To change this to a Point-to-Point Network, use the Interface configuration command `ip ospf network point-to-point` on all Interfaces where you want to disable the DR/BDR election process
