- You can specify the Interfaces that belong to a Point-to-Point Network by Configuring the `network` command.
  You can also configure OSPF directly on the Interface with the `ip ospf` command.

- The basic syntax for the `network` command is as follows:
 
  Router (config-router) # `network network-address wildcard-mask area area-id`

- The `network-address wildcard-mask` syntax is used to enable OSPF on Interfaces.
  Any Interfaces on a Router that match this part of the command are enabled to send and receive OSPF Packets
- The `area area-id` syntax refers to the OSPF area.
  When configuring Single-Area OSPFv2, the `network` command must be configured with the same `area-id` value on all Routers.
  Although any area ID can be used, it is good practice to use an Area ID of 0 with Single-Area OSPFv2.
  This convention makes it easier if the Network is later altered to support Multiarea OSPFv2.
