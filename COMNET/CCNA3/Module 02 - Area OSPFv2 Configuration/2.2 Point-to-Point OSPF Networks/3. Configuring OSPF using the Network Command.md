Within Routing configuration mode, there are two ways to identify the Interfaces that will participate in the OSPFv2 Routing Process
- In the first example, the Wild Mask Identifies the Interface based on the Network Addresses
  Any active Interface that is configured with an IPv4 Address belonging to that Network will participate in the OSPFv2 Routing Process

  Some IOS versions allow the Subnet Mask to be entered instead of the Wildcard Mask.
  The IOS then converts the Subnet Mask to the Wildcard Mask Format.
