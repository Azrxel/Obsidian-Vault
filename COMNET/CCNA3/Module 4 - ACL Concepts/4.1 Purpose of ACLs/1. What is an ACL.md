- An ACL is a series of IOS commands that are used to filter packets based on information found in the Packet Header.
- By Default, a Router does not have any ACLs configured.
- When an ACL is applied to an Interface, the Router performs the additional task of evaluating all Network Packets as they pass through the Interface to determine if the Packet can be Forwarded.
  - An ACL uses a sequential list of permit or deny statements, known as Access Control Entries (ACEs).

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>: ACEs are also commonly called ACL Statements.

  - When Network Traffic passes through an Interface configured with an ACL, the Router compares the information within the packet against each ACE in sequential order, to determine if the Packet Matches one of the ACEs.
    - This Process is called <mark class="hltr-cyan">Packet Filtering</mark>. 

Several Tasks performed by Routers require the use of ACLs to identify Traffic:
- Limit Network Traffic to increase Network Performance
- Provide Traffic Flow Control
- Provide a basic level of Security for Network Access
- Filter Traffic Based on Traffic Type
- Screen Hosts to Permit or Deny access to Network Services
- Provide Priority to certain classes of Network Traffic
