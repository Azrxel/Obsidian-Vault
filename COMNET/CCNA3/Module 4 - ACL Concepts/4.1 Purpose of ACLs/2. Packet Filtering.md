- Packet Filtering controls access to a Network by analyzing the Incoming and/or Outgoing Packets and Forwarding them or Discarding them based on given Criteria.
- Packet Filtering can occur at Layer 3 or Layer 4.

- Cisco Routers support two types of ACLs:
	- **Standard ACLs**
	  ACLs only Filter at <mark class="hltr-cyan">Layer 3</mark> using the <mark class="hltr-red">Source</mark> IPv4 Addresses only.
	- **Extended ACLs**
	  ACLs filter at Layer 3 using the Source and/or Destination IPv4 Address.
	  They can also filter at Layer 4 using TCP UDP Ports, and optional Protocol type information for Finer Control.
