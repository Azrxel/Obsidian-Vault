There is a limit on the number of ACLs that can be applied on a router interface. For example, a dual-stacked (i.e, IPv4 and IPv6) router interface can have up to **four** ACLs applied, as shown in the figure.Â 

Specifically, a router interface can have:
- One <mark class="hltr-pink">Outbound</mark> <mark class="hltr-green">IPv4</mark> ACL
- One <mark class="hltr-cyan">Inbound</mark> <mark class="hltr-green">IPv4</mark> ACL
- One <mark class="hltr-pink">Outbound</mark> <mark class="hltr-red">IPv6</mark> ACL
- One <mark class="hltr-cyan">Inbound</mark> <mark class="hltr-red">IPv6</mark> ACL

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>: ACLs do not have to be configured in both directions. 
The number of ACLs and their direction applied to the interface will depend on the security policy of the organization.
