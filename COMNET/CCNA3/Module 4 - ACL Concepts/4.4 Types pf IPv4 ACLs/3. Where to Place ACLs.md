- Every ACL should be placed where it has the greatest impact on efficiency.
- Extended ACLs should be located as close as possible to the source of the traffic to be filtered.
- Standard ACLs should be located as close to the destination as possible.

| The extent of organizational control                               | Placement of the ACL can depend on whether or not the organization has control of both the source and destination networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Bandwidth of the networks involved                                 | It may be desirable to filter unwanted traffic at the source to prevent transmission of bandwidth-consuming traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Ease of configuration                                              | - It may be easier to implement an ACL at the destination, but traffic will use bandwidth unnecessarily.<br>    <br>- An extended ACL could be used on each router where the traffic originated. This would save bandwidth by filtering the traffic at the source, but it would require creating extended ACLs on multiple routers. |
