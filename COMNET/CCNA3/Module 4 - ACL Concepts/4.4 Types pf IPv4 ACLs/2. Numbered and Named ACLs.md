### Numbered ACLS
- ACLs numbered 1-99, or 1300-1999 are standard ACLs.
- While ACLs numbered 100-199, or 2000-2699 are extended ACLs.

### Named ACLs
- Named ACLs are the preferred method to use when configuring ACLs. 
- Specifically, <mark class="hltr-yellow">standard</mark> and <mark class="hltr-yellow">extended</mark> ACLs can be named to provide information about the purpose of the ACL. 
- For example, naming an extended ACL FTP-FILTER is far better than having a numbered ACL 100.

- The `ip access-list` global configuration command is used to create a named ACL, as shown in the following example.
