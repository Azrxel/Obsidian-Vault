- A Wildcard Mask is similar to a Subnet Mask (uses ANDing process to Identify which bits is  an IPv4 Address to match).
- Unlike a Subnet Mask, in which Binary 1 is equal to a match and Binary 0 is not a match, in a Wildcard Mask, the Reverse is true.
- An IPv4 ACE uses a 32-Bit Wildcard Mask to determine which bits of the Address to Examine for a Match.
- Wildcard Masks use the following rules to match Binary 1s and 0s:
  - **Wildcard Mask bit 0** - Match the corresponding bit value in the address
  - **Wildcard Mask bit 1** - Ignore the corresponding bit value in the address
