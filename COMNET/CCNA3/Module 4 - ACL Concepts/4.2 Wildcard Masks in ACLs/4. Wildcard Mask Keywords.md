Cisco IOS provides two keywords to identify the most common uses of wildcard masking. The two keywords are:

- **host** - This keyword substitutes for the 0.0.0.0 mask. 
  This mask states that all IPv4 address bits must match to filter just one host address.
  
- **any** - This keyword substitutes for the 255.255.255.255 mask. 
  This mask says to ignore the entire IPv4 address or to accept any addresses.
