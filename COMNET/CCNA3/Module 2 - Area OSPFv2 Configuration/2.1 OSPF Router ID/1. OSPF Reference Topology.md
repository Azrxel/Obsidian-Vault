The Figure shows the Topology used  for configuring OSPFv2 in this module.

The Routers in the Topology have a starting configuration, including Interface Addresses.

There is currently no Static Routing or Dynamic Routing configured on any of the Routers.

All Interfaces on R1, R2, and R3 (except the Loopback 1 on R2) are within the OSPF Backbone Area.

The ISP Router is used as the Gateway to the Internet of the Routing Domain.
