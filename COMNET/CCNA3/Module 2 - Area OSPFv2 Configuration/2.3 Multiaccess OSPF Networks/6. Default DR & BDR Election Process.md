The OSPF Dr and BDR Election is based on the following criteria , in sequential order:
1. The Routers in the Network elect the Router with the highest Interface Priority as the DR.
   The Router with the second highest Interface Priority then becomes the BDR.
   - The Priority can be configured to be any number between 0 - 255.
   - If the Interface Priority value is set to 0, that Interface cannot be elected as DR nor BDR.
   - The Default Priority of Multiaccess Broadcast Interfaces is 1.
2. If the Interface Priorities are equal, then the Router with the highest Router ID is elected as the DR.
   The Router with the second highest Router ID is the BDR.
   - The elections process takes place when the first Router with an OSPF-Enabled Interface is active on the Network.
     If all of the Routers on the Network have not finished booting, it is possible that a Router with a lower Router ID becomes the DR.
   - The addition of a new Router does not initiate a new Election Process.
