- In multiaccess Networks, OSPF elects a DR and BDR.
  The Dr is responsible for collecting and distributing LSAs sent and received.
  The DR uses the Multicast IPv4 Address 224.0.0.5 which is meant for all OSPF Routers.
- A BDR is also elected in case the DR fails.
  The BDR listens passively and maintains a relationship with all the Routers.
  If the DR stops producing Hello Packets, the BDR promotes itself and assumes the Role of DR.
- All other Routers become a DROTHER (a router that is neither the DR nor the BDR).
  DROTHERs use the Multiaccess address 224.0.0.6 (all Designated Routers) to send OSPF Packets to the DR and BDR.
  Only the DR and BDR listen for 224.0.0.6.
