- The cost of an OSPF Route is the accumulated value from one Router to the destination Network.
- Assuming the `auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000` command  has been configured on all three Routers, the cost of the links between each Router is now 10.
  The Loopback Interfaces have a default cost of 1.

- You can calculate the cost for each Router to reach each Network.
- For example, the Total Cost for R1 to reach the 10.10.2.0/24 Network is 11.
  This is because the link to R2 cost = 10 and the loopback default cost = 1.
  10 + 1 = 11.
- You can verify this with the `show ip route` command.
