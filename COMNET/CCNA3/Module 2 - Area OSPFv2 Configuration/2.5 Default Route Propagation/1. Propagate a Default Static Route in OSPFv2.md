To propagate a Default Route, the Edge Router must be configured with the following:
- A Default Static Route using the `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next-hop-address | exit-intf]` command.
- The `default-information originate` Router configuration command.
  This instructs R2 to be the source of the Default Route Information and Propagate the Default Static Route in OSPF Updates.

In the example, R2 is configured with a Loopback to simulate a connection to the Internet.
A Default Route is configured and Propagated to all other OSPF Routers in the Routing Domain.

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>: When configuring Static Routes, best practice is to use the next-hop IP Address.
However, when simulating a connection to the Internet, there is no next-hop IP Address.
Therefore, we use the `exit intf` argument.
