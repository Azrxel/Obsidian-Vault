- LSUs are also used to forward OSPF Routing Updates.
  An LSU packet can contain 11 different types of OSPFv2 LSAs.
  OSPFv3 renamed several of these LSAs and also contains two additional LSAs.
- LSU and LSA are often used interchangeably, but the correct hierarchy is LSU packets contain messages.
