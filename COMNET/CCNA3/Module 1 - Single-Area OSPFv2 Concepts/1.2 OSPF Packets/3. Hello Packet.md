The OSPF <mark class="hltr-cyan">Type 1</mark> Packet is the <mark class="hltr-yellow">Hello Packet</mark>.
Hello Packets are used to do the following:
- Discover OSPF Neighbors and establish Neighbor Adjacencies.
- Advertise parameters on which Two Routers must agree to become Neighbors.
- Elect the <mark class="hltr-blue">Designated Router</mark> (<mark class="hltr-red">DR</mark>) and <mark class="hltr-pink">Backup Designated Router</mark> (<mark class="hltr-yellow">BDR</mark>) on multiaccess networks like Ethernet.
  Point-to-point links do not require DR or BDR.
