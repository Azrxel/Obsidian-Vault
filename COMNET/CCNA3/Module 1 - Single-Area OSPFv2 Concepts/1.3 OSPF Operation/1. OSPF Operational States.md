|     State      | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Down State   | 1. No hello packets received = Down<br>2. Router sends hello packets<br>3. Transition to Init state                                                                   |
|   Init State   | 1. Hello packets are received from neighbor<br>2. They contain the Router ID of the sending Router<br>3. Transition to Two-Way state                                  |
| Two-Way State  | 1. In this state, communication between the Two Routers is bidirectional<br>2. On multiaccess links, the Routers elect a DR and BDR<br>3. transition to ExStart state |
| ExStart State  | 1. On point-to-point Networks, the two Routers decide which Router will initiate the DBD Packet Exchange and decide upon the initial DBD Packet sequence number       |
| Exchange State | 1. Routers exchange DBD packets<br>2. If additional Router information is required, then transition to Loading; otherwise, transition to the Full State               |
| Loading State  | 1. LSRs and LSUs are used to gain additional Route Information<br>2. Routes are Processed using the SPF algorithm<br>3. Transition to the Full State                  |
|   Full State   | The link-state database of the Router is fully synchronized                                                                                                           |
