Multiaccess Networks can create two challenges for OSPF regarding the flooding of LSAs, as Follows:
- **Creation of Multiple Adjacencies**
  Ethernet Networks could potentially interconnect many OSPF Routers over a common link.
  Creating adjacencies with every Router would lead to an excessive number of LSAs exchange between Routers on the same Network.
- **Extensive Flooding of LSAs**
  Link-State Routers flood their LSAs any time OSPF is initialized, or when there is a change in the Topology.
  This flooding can become excessive.
