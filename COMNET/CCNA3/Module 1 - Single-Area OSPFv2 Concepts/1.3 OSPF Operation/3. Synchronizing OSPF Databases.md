After the Two-Way State, Routers transition to the Database Synchronization States.
This is a Three step Process, as Follows:
- **Decide First Router**:
  The Router with the highest Router ID sends its DBD First.
- **Exchange DBDs**:
  As many as needed to convey the Database.
  The other Router must acknowledge each DBD with an LSAck Packet.
- **Send an LSR**: Each Router compares the DBD information with the local LSDB.
  If the DBD has more current Link Information, the Router Transitions to the Loading State.


After all LSRs have been exchanged and satisfied, the Routers are considered synchronized and in a Full State.
Updates (LSUs) are sent:
- When a change is perceived (incremental updates)
- Every 30 Minutes
