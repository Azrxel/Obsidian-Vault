- To determine if there is an OSPF Neighbor on the link, the Router sends a Hello Packet that contains its Router ID out all OSPF-Enabled Interfaces.
  The Hello Packet is sent to the reserved 'All OSPF Routers IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.5.
  Only OSPFv2 Routers will process these Packets.
- The OSPF Router ID is used by the OSPF process uniquely identify each Router in the OSPF Area.
  A Router ID is a 32-Bit Number formatted like an IPv4 Address and assigned to uniquely identify a Router among OSPF peers.
- When a neighboring OSPF-Enabled Router receives a Hello Packet with a Router ID that is not within its Neighbor list, the receiving Router attempts to establish an Adjacency with the Initiating Router.

The process Routers use to Establish Adjacency on a Multiaccess Network:

|     | State              | Description |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1   | Down to Init State |             |
| 2   | Init State         |             |
| 3   | Two-Way State      |             |
| 4   | Elect the DR & BDR |             |
