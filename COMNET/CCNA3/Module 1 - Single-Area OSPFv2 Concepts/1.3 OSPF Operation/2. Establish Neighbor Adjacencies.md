- To determine if there is an OSPF Neighbor on the link, the Router sends a Hello Packet that contains its Router ID out all OSPF-Enabled Interfaces.
  The Hello Packet is sent to the reserved 'All OSPF Routers IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.5.
  Only OSPFv2 Routers will process these Packets.
- The OSPF Router ID is used by the OSPF process uniquely identify each Router in the OSPF Area.
  A Router ID is a 32-Bit Number formatted like an IPv4 Address and assigned to uniquely identify a Router among OSPF peers.
- When a neighboring OSPF-Enabled Router receives a Hello Packet with a Router ID that is not within its Neighbor list, the receiving Router attempts to establish an Adjacency with the Initiating Router.

The process Routers use to Establish Adjacency on a Multiaccess Network:

| 1   | Down to Init State | When OSPFv2 is enabled on the interface, R1 transition from Down to Init and Starts sending OSPFv2 Hellos out the interface in an attempt to Discover Neighbors                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2   | Init State         | When R2 receives a hello from the previously unknown Router R1, it adds R1's Router ID to the Neighbor list and Responds with Hello Packet containing its own Router ID                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 4   | Elect the DR & BDR | The DR and BDR election occurs, where the Router with the highest Router or Highest priority is elected as the DR, and second highest is the BDR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
