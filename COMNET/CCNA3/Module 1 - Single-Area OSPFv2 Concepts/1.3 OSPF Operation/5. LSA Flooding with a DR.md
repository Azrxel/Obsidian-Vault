- An increase in the number of Routers on a Multiaccess Network also increases the number of LSAs exchanged between the Routers.
  This flooding of LSAs significantly impacts the operation of OSPF.
- If every Router in a Multiaccess Network has to flood and acknowledge all received LSAs to all other Routers on that same Multiaccess Network, the Network Traffic would become quite chaotic.
- On Multiaccess Networks, OSPF elects a DR to be the Collection and Distribution point for LSAs Sent and Received.
  A BDR is also elected in case DR fails.
  All other Routers become DROTHERS.
  A DROTHER is a Router that is neither the DR nor the BDR.
  
  <mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>:
  The DR is only used for the dissemination of LSAs.
  The Router will still use the best next-hop Router indicated in the Routing table for the Forwarding of all other Packets.
