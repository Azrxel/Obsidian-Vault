- OSPFv3 is the OSPFv2 equivalent for exchanging IPv6 prefixes.
  OSPFv3 exchanges Routing Information to populate the IPv6 Routing Table with remote prefixes.
  - <mark class="hltr-yellow">Note</mark>: 
    With OSPFv3 Address Families feature, OSPFv3 includes support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
    OSPF Address Families is beyond the scope of this curriculum.
  
- OSPFv3 has the same functionality as OSPFv2, but  uses IPv6 as the network layer transport, communicating with OSPFv3 peers and advertising IPv6 Routes.
  OSPFv3 also uses the SPF algorithm as the computation engine to determine the best paths throughout the Routing Domain
- OSPFv3 has separate process from its IPv4 counterpart.
  The process and operation are basically the same as in IPv4 Routing Protocol, but run independently.
