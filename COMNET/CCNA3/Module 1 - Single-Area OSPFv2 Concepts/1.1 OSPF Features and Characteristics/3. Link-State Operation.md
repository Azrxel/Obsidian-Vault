To maintain routing information, OSPF Routers complete a generic link-state Routing process to reach a state of convergence.
The following are the link-state Routing steps that are completed by a Router:
1. Establish Neighbor Adjacencies
2. Exchange Link-State Advertisements
3. Build the Link State Database
4. Execute the SPF Algorithm
5. Choose the Best Route
