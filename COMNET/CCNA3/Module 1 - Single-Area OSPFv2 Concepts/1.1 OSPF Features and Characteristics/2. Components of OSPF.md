- All routing protocols share similar components. they all use routing protocol messages to exchange route information.
  The messages help build data structures, which are then processed using routing algorithm.
- Routers running OSPF exchange message to convey routing information using <mark class="hltr-red">five</mark> <u>Types of Packets</u>

| Hello Packet                                      |     |
| Database Description Packet                       |     |
| Link-State Request Packet                         |     |
| Link-State Update Packet                          |     |
| Link-State Acknowledgement Packet                 |     |
These Packets are used to discover neighboring Routers and also to exchange routing information to maintain accurate information about the network

OSPF messages are used to create and maintain Three OSPF databases, as follows:

|          Database          |     Table      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|     Adjacency Database     | Neighbor Table | 1. List of all neighbor Routers to which a Router has established bi-directional communication.<br>2. This table is unique for each Router.<br>3. Can be viewed using the `show ip ospf neighbor` command.                        |
| Link-State Database (LSDB) | Topology Table | 1. Lists information about all other Routers in the Network.<br>2. The Database represents the Network LSDB.<br>3. All Routers within an area have identical LSDB.<br>4. Can be viewed using the `show ip ospf database` command. |
