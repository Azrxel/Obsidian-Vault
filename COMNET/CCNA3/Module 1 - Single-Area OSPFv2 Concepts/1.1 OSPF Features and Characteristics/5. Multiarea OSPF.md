- The hierarchical-topology design options with multiarea OSPF can offer the following advantages.
- **Smaller Routing Tables**:
  Tables are smaller because there are fewer Routing Table entries.
  This is because Network Addresses can be summarized between areas,
  Route summarization is not enabled by default.
- **Reduced link-state update overhead**:
  Designing multiarea OSPF with smaller areas minimizes processing and memory requirements.
- **Reduced frequency of SPF calculations**:
  Multiarea OSPF localize the impact of a topology change within an area.
  For instance, it minimizes Routing Update impact because LSA flooding stops at the area Boundary.
