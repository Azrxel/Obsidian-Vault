To make OSPF more efficient and scalable, OSPF supports hierarchical Routing using areas.
An OSPF area is a group of Routers that share the same link-state information in their LSDBs.
OSPF can be implemented in one of two ways, as follows:
- **Single-Area OSPF** - All Routers are in one area. Best practice is to use area 0.
- **Multiarea OSPF** - OSPF is implemented using multiple areas, in a hierarchical fashion.
  All areas must connect to the backbone area (area 0). 
  Routers interconnecting the areas are referred to as Area Border Routers (ABRs).

The focus of this module is on single-area OSPFv2
