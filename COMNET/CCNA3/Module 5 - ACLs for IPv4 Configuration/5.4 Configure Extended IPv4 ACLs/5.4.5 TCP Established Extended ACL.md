TCP can also perform basic Stateful Firewall Services using the TCP `established` keyword.

- The `established` keyword enabled inside traffic to exit the Inside Private Network and Permits the returning reply traffic to enter the Inside Private Network.
- TCP Traffic generated by an Outside Host and Attempting to communicate wit an Inside Host is Denied.

The ACL is then applied Outbound on the R1 G0/0/0 Interface.

The `show access-list` command shows that inside hosts are accessing the secure Web Resources from the Internet.
