#Sub-Module 

---
The topology below is used to demonstrate configuring and applying two named extended IPv4 ACLs to an Interface:

- **SURFING**
  This will permit inside HTTP and HTTPS Traffic to exit to the Internet

- **BROWSING**
  This will only Permit Returning Web Traffic to the Inside Hosts while all other Traffic exiting the R1 G0/0/0 Interface is Implicitly Denied

The SURFING ACL permits HTTP and HTTPS traffic from inside users to exit the G0/0/1 interface connected to the internet. 

Web traffic returning from the internet is permitted back into the inside private network by the BROWSING ACL.

The SURFING ACL is applied inbound and the BROWSING ACL is applied outbound on the R1 G0/0/0 interface.

The show access-lists command is used to verify the ACL statistics. 

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Notice</mark> that the permit secure HTTPS counters (i.e., eq 443) in the SURFING ACL and the return established counters in the BROWSING ACL have increased.
