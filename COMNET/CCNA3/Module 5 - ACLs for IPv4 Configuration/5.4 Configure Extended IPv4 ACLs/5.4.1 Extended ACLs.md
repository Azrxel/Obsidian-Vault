Extended ACLs provide a greater degree of control.
They can filter on:
- Source Address
- Destination Address, Protocol (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Port Number

Extended ACLs can be created as:
- **Numbered Extended ACL**
  Created using the `access-list access-list-number` global configuration command.
- **Named Extended ACL**
  Created using the `ip access-list extended access-list-name`.
