An Extended ACL can be edited using a text Editor when many changes are Required.
Or, if the Edit Applies to One or Two ACEs, then sequence Numbers can be used

Example:
The ACE Sequence Number 10 in the SURFING ACL has an Incorrect Source IP Network Address

![[5.4.8 Incorrect Source IP Network Address.png|Incorrect Source IP Network Address]]

To correct this error the original statement is removed with the `no sequence-#` command and the corrected statement is added replacing the original statement.
The show access-lists command output verifies the configuration change.
