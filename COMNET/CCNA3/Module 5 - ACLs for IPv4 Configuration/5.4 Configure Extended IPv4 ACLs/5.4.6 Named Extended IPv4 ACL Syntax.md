- Naming an ACL makes it easier to understand its function.
- To create a named extended ACL, use the `ip access-list extended` configuration command.

In the example, a named extended ACL called NO-FTP-ACCESS is created and the prompt changed to **Named Extended ACL** configuration mode.
ACE statements are entered in the **Named Extended ACL**  *sub configuration mode*.
