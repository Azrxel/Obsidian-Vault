All Access Control Lists (ACLs) must be planned.

When Configuring a Complex ACL, it is suggested that you:
- Use a [[2. Text Editor Method|Text Editor]] and Write Out the Specifics of the Policy to be Implemented.
- Add the IOS Configuration commands to accomplish those Tasks.
- Include remarks to Document the ACL.
- Copy and Paste the commands onto the Device.
- Always thoroughly test an ACL to ensure that it correctly applies the Desired Policy.
