An ACL ACE can be deleted or added using the ACL Sequence Numbers.
- Use the `ip access-list standard` command to edit an ACL.
- Statements cannot be overwritten using an existing Sequence Number.
  - The current statement must be deleted first with the `no 10` command.
  - Then the correct ACE can be added using the Sequence Number.
