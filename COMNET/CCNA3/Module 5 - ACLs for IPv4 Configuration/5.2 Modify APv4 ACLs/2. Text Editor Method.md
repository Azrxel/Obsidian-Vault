ACLs with Multiple ACEs should be created in a Text Editor.

This allows you to:
- Plan the Required ACEs,
- and then Paste it into the Router Interface.
- It also simplifies the Tasks to Edit and Fix an ACL

To correct an Error in an ACL:
- Copy the ACL from the Running Configuration and paste it into the Text Editor.
- Remove the previously Configured ACL on the Router.
- Copy and Paste the Edited ACL back to the Router
